# The Grappler's Handbook

A website to be used as a quick reference for grappling techniques

## Overview

The grappler's handbook is my attempt at at creating an open educational resource for the grappling  community. This is a long-term work in progress and filming and uploading videos is the biggest bottleneck for me right now. I plan to continuously update the material while I work on other projects.

### 

All the material is drawn from own knowledge which I've gained over the years through coaches, training partners, seminars, instructionals, and my own experimentation in training and in competition. I still have a lot of content I wish to put on the website but reserving a place and a partner to film with limits how frequently I can do that. This is meant to be a quick reference and a surface-level introduction to various topics and is not a comprehensive dive into any one thing in particular.
