        <p>The “neutral” position is when both grapplers are on their feet and where an individual has the option to either attempt to take their opponent 
            down to the ground or willingly take bottom position by pulling guard. This section focuses on takedowns but also included are a few 
            techniques categorized as “sacrifice” throws or techniques, where the practitioner quickly exposes themself to bottom position in order to 
            immediately end up in top position or in order to set up a submission (e.g. sumi gaeshi, kani basami, flying armbar etc). The term “neutral” 
            is borrowed from American collegiate wrestling, where it distinguishes the standing position from the “top-bottom” position on the mat.</p>
