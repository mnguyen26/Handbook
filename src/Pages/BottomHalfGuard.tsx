            reverse-de-la-riva, deep half guard, lockdown, reverse half-guard, butterfly half-guard, 
            coyote-guard and more. What they all seem to have in common is that the guard player is
            controlling or attached to one of the legs of the top player with the longitudinal axes
            of their bodies more or less pointed in the same direction. I don't think it's that 
            important to distinguish what is and what isn't half-guard. What's important to know is 
            that if you're old and/or fat, you probably play some form of half-guard because it doesn't
             require you to move dynamically; it's based on close-range attachment. `],

                     It's based on building up on and underhook and slowly wrestling for top position. It's 
                     extremely simple and I think it's one of the more important skills to learn early because it
                      will be most people's first application of wrestling up from guard which you will need to be
                       able to do to balance your submission attacks from any guard. `,

                     from wrestling to finish this position will be very useful. `],

                             to be aware of if you're trying to pass half-guard on top. Use you knee-shield to open up 
                             some space for your underhook, build up on your bottom elbow, and shoot your underhook; first
                             with your elbow and then pummel the rest of your arm. As soon as you have structure that you've
                             built up on and have taken your underhook, your next focus should be to keep your opponent from
                             rotating away from you and getting out from underneath them. Keep them from rotating away by 
                             controlling and internally rotating their leg with your outside leg and/or underhook arm and

                            waist which is what I see most commonly, or you can transition to a single leg. I believe 
                            the single leg to be the best option both because it offers several finishes that are tried
                             and proven from the sport of wrestling and because it keeps you more attached to your 
                            opponent's leg keeping you side on to them. The worst thing that can happen when coming up
                             on an underhook is that your opponent becomes free to move away from you. This starts with
                             them freeing their leg and then there are a number of ways they can counter you. The most
                             common reaction by the top player to an underhook is for them to circle away and grab a
                             front headlock. `
