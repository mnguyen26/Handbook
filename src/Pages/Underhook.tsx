Offensively, it allows you to enter the greatest variety of takedowns including leg grabs, throws, trips as well as advancing to other positions such as double underhooks or to the back. Defensively, it acts as a solid barrier to leg grabs as it limits your opponent's ability to change levels but most importantly it blocks the path to your back. `],

                        what leg you first step forward with as you begin to run your feet. If you have an opponent who has a dangerous whizzer kick/uchi mata you might want to 
                        avoid stepping first with your outside leg because it gives them space to step in front of you and attempt a throw. Against someone who is very competent 
                        at upper body throws they can even lat drop you. If this concerns you, step forward first with your inside foot or the one that is closer to your opponent
